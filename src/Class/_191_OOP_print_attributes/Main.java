the attributes are name and color -both are strings and amount which is an int.
their visibility is public.

asString returns a string showing all the Atts in a format.

for example:

   Atts a = new Atts();
   a.name = "table";
   a.color = "brown";
   a.amount = 1;

   System.out.println(a.asString());

prints:
name: table color: brown amount: 1
