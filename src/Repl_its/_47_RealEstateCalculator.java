Write a program that will estimate your property price.
This program should work with 3 house types: Condo, Townhouse and Single Family Home. Starting price for Condo = 50000,  for Townhouse = 75000, Single Family Home = 95000. Based on number of bedrooms, add to the price of your property 30000 for every bedroom. Then you need to ask if property has backyard. Add 5000 to the property price if it's true. Backyard shouldn't be available for Condo, so display message "Backyard is not available for condo!", (don't increase property price!), in case someone would try to select backyard for condo.  Then ask user for garage presence. If the property has garage, add 20000 to the property price for every spot. If amount of garage spots exceeds 10 spots (grater then 10), display message: " Pardon,  it's not a public parking!" and don't increase property price. Then, ask user for metro accessibility. If metro is closer than 1 mile (inclusive), add to the property price 10000. If metro is in the radius from 1 mile to 3 miles,  add to the property price 5000.  Then, ask user for highway accessibility. If highway is closer than 1 mile (inclusive), add to the property price 15000. If highway is in the radius from 1 to 5 miles,  add to the property price 8000.  And if highway is in the radius from 5 mile to 20 miles (inclusive),  add to the property price 4000.  Then your program should ask about nearest school rating. If school's rating is in the range from 10 (inclusive) to 8 points,  add to the property price 45000. If school's rating is less than 8 points and more or equals to 4 points,  add to the property price 20000. Otherwise, add 5000 to the property price.  Then, ask user if any of the family members smoking. If so, reduce property price for 5000. At the end, display message: "Market report has been generated.", and display underneath:  "Your estimate market price is: propertyPrice$"
